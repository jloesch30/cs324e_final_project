## TODO 

- [ ] Game GUI implemented into regular gameplay, including all button functionality
- [ ] Portal gun design (second level of scene hierarchy attached to the player model)
- [ ] Better portal hit detection with objects, i.e. The projectile hits an object and despawns (does not pass through the object)
- [ ] Player obstacle collision detection (player can stand on platforms and will not fall through) 
- [ ] Map input (in XML or JSON), create a reader class to make the maps
- [ ] Highscore file output on the last victory screen
- [ ] Design 2 or 3 maps and make them into transferable XML or JSON data (including the coordinates of the player spawn, exit spawn, and obstacles in the scene)
- [ ] [optional] Extra hazards such as spikes
